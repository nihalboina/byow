## Classes and Data Structures

Something that makes the number of discrete rooms, randomly generated 
between a certain lower threshold and higher threshold

Then, Designate the size of each room from another certain lower thresh to 
higher thresh, given that no ioob occurs

Then, connect each room to each other room By randomly assigning 
connections, perhaps each room has a possible of four exits (maybe 3/2 
depending on the size and location), and these exits can be designated 
with other open exits of other rooms, subject to change later?

## Algorithms

## Persistence

idk what to do here but basically I'm going to keep the rooms white and 
the background black and the paths gray for now
